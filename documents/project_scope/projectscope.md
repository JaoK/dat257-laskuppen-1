The scope of this project is to create a website for a reading competition for upper-secondary-school students primarily. The website tracks users reading progress and students are awarded points for the number of pages they have read and on their review of the book. The website lets the students/classes compete against each other and also gives the teachers more insight into students reading habits and capabilities, allowing them to have more material to grade students.

The external stakeholder is Linda Efson and she is a Swedish and English teacher at NIT Gymnasium and she runs this competition with her students each year.
