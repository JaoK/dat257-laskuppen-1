what do I want to learn or understand better?

A: This sprint, I worked with David on the page that displays review books. I got to work with
class components in react, which was new for us and a bit tricky. We also connected our filters
and search function to the backend, so we also wrote some quries.

B: I want to continue to learn react and also see more about class componets, I also want to continue to keep learning the backend parts of our project and also to improve my understading
of the database part.

A->B: By continuing to write code, talk with my team-mates to learn with each other.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: This week we have continued to spenda time in discord when we are coding which is awesome 
to keep learning from eachother. We have also been performing our daily standups at our
meetings to involve each other with the different tasks of the sprint.

B: I want to keep up with the strategy we are using right now.

A->B: Keep up our meetings, doing pair programming, joining discord when coding and participating in daily standups.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: This week I have been participating in our 3 weekly meetings, have participated in our daily standups to involve eachother in what we are doing at each meeting. I have also been logging my hours of work. I also have been using the trello board to do task breakdown for this weeks user stories in the sprint. I also got to try out to be the scrum masters for this 
sprint, and got to monitor and check in on the progress of the sprint. 

B: I want to continue with the workflow I am using right now. With additions that might arise when we are discussing our sprint retrospective.

A->B: Keep up with the current strategy and keep on evaluating our sprints.

A: I have been working on the books page. I have also been working on the team reflection.
