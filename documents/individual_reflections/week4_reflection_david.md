This week has been our first sprint and i have done work in a lot of different places at the start of the week i created tables for the database and after that i worked on i review form and then i connected it to the backend. 

My main focus this week has been getting used to the react framework and learning how to use it effectively and this is something i want to  keep learning. As we have different backgrounds i have tried to explain what im i am doing while writing code so to help other to learn and also to learn better my self. 

I think we as a team are working effectively and using the scrum board to track the progress and divide tasks. 

As for next week i want to keep learning react and keep creating pages for the website and get more used to working with the backend.
