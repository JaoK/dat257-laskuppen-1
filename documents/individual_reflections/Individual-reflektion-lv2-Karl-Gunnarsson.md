what do I want to learn or understand better?

This week we had our first start up meeting with our external client. We were introduced to the 
her ideas and the functionality she wanted in the application. Based on this we created a mockup of the 
applikation in FIGMA. In the future I want to learn our external clients needs in detail. This will be acomplished by
presenting our mockup to our external stakeholder, getting feedback from her, and updating the design to fit her needs. 


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Right now we have ensured tight comunication through our meetings, in the future I want to continue
to contribute with my own perspectives and ideas, which will be done through our meetings.


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week I have been partcipating in the team's meetings, and worked a lot on the mockup for the applikation. Next week I
would like to contribute by starting to create user stories, which will be possible after our next meeting with our
external client were we are going to present the mock up design.
