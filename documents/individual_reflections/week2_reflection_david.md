Week 2 Individual Reflection, David 

This week we have made good progress on defining the project by having a meeting 
with the stakeholder, creating the mockup and looking att different APIs to use. 

Personally i have worked on the mockup and written the project description and i 
think me and we as a team are in a good place to soon start working on the actual 
code. But to get to that stage we first have to start working on the user stories 
and get input from our stakeholder on our mockup.
