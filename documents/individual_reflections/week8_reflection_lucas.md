what do I want to learn or understand better?

A: This sprint I fixed mostly bugs and some mobile responsiveness

B: Making legitimate mobile versions using css.

A->B: Researched the standard practice for doing so.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: Be on time, actively participating in all the small parts of our project.

B: Be more "visa framfötterna" when it comes to bringing in new aspects and points of entry. Making people think twice and maybe learn something from that. 

A->B: Don't know, maybe work some on myself and evalute how I work in a team.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: Trelloboard, dailystandups, final reflection.

B: I feel pretty done with the project, maybe think more about myself and my evaluation.

A->B: Current strategy feels good. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Well since it's the last one of these I'm writing I would say the entire project. We're done!
