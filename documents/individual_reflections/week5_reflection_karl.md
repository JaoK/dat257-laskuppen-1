what do I want to learn or understand better?

B: I want to continue to learn react, it is a lot of fun! I also want to keep learning the backend parts of our project!

A->B: By continuing to write code, talk with my team-mates to learn with each other.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
