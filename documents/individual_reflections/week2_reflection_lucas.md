What do I want to learn or understand better?

Currently I'm in a position where I know more and are more experienced in the technical
department than I am in the agile/scrum. I want to learn more about working agile and breaking down
user stories to tasks and do a good effort estimation so we can complete these tasks in a sprint. 
I think this is something you learn by doing and the minetest workshop was a good "test" for that.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team to learn something new?

Again I can always be there and ready to co-operate with any teammate but also be in a position
where i always learn more and ready to absorb new information and effectively apply this to 
the project.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

This week we met with the third party that "ordered" the website we are going to create, I was
there and noted every requirement she had but also when we broke it down to functions that 
we later on are going to turn into user stories. Also was there planning the meetings for 
next week and how we are going to work with scrum when writing user stories/effort estimation/tasks.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

I helped with the mock-up and came with design ideas derived from the customers functionality requirements.
But also helped write the description of the project.
