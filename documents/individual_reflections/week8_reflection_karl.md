what do I want to learn or understand better?

A: In the end we ended up deciding that we did not have the time to learn a new framework for doing testing. So we opted in for user tests instead which I took part in this sprint. We also got a last minute request from our stakeholder, that she wanted the webpage made responsive for mobiles also.

B: I would like to know more about making websites responsives for mobiles.

A->B: By continuing to write code, talk with my team-mates to learn with each other, I also want to take a look and see if there are any special css or react ways for making our webpage responsive for mobiles also.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
