what do I want to learn or understand better?

Right now we are in the middle of our first sprint. Since the last reflection we have created the majority of our user stories and has started to implement some of them. Right now I have been working a lot with the front end I.E the user interface of the website doing pair programming with both David and Anton. I also worked on creating the database, which was something new for me, as i have never worked with databases or SQL before. We also started to connect the review form to the backend and database.

In the future I want to continue to learn more about the front end, i.e more about React, html and CSS, but also try to get into the backend more and continue to learn about databases.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

On our latest meeting, we talked about how we can improve our engagment of each others part in the project. We decided to start every meeting with a short "stand up presentation" where we show and explain what we have worked on since the latest meeting. So during this, I hope we can all can help each other learn something new

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I have particpated in our weekly meetings, partcipated in the creation of our user stories, task breakdown and effort estimation. I have picked a user story and started to begin working on the tasks from the task breakdown in our trello board, and today we also went through of our first team reflektion, where we disscussed our process today and how we are going to improve it in the future. We decided that we are going to improve on how we communicate about what we are working on for instance.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Since the last reflektion, I have worked upon setting up the Database, creating the grid for the layout of the webpages when we started to implement the send review page, started to connect the review page to the backend and database and also contributed to creating the userstories.
