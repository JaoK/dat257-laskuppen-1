As this is the first week of the course my answer will be a bit generalized. 

What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn about the about the process of agile project management. Thus I want to get to know our group better, and witness how we evolve as an agile project management team. I also want to use this opportunity to learn about creating a fullstack application, using modern technology as the front end framework: React, the backend framework: Express etc.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By ensuring seamless communication I hope that everybody can learn from each other as we all have different backgrounds and knowledge. For instance, I could introduce our group to version control with git. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 

As we have not yet createad our scrum board etc, I have only contributed to the establishing our workflow during our start up meeting.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
                
We have not yet written any code or documentation, so I have only contributed to creation of our social contract.
