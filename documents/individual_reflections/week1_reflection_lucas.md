What do I want to learn or understand better?

Currently I'm relatively inexperienced in group dynamics but I want to 
explore and learn more about my own role in a group and how I can use my 
knowledge to contribute. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team to learn something new?

I'd say I'm skillful when it comes to the programming part of the course 
and with that comes the responsibility to help me team members with whatever 
they need. And whenever someone says they need help I would gladly do my best.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

We haven't started working that much with scrum yet but in our first meeting we 
established work flow and how we all are going to work with a scrum board. 

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

The only thing we have delivered so far is social contract which I and the 
rest of the team members where a part of.
