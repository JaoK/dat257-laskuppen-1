What do I want to learn or understand better?

Probably indepth knowledge of react and scrum, why we do what we do. Currently I'm coding a lot 
with my hands tied behind my back, not really knowing the technicalities. To do this I will keep researching 
react but also code some on a side project to further expand my knowledge.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team to learn something new?

Being there always but also pair program with multiple different people. I do this as much as possible
now but sometimes I do work more efficient alone. In the future I will always seek to program with others
to maximize the profit for the external stakeholder but also for my sake.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

Task breakdown, reflecting on previous sprint but also planning the sprint we are in right now.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

Was there and wrote the team reflection, also finishing user stories so that we satisfies
the external stake holder.
