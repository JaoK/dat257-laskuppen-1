What do I want to learn or understand better?

React, react, react and probably even more react. Now we've started heavily with programming and I
feel like I'm lacking in the programming department. Which probably is unusual but a good feeling,
it is nice knowing that I have things I need to learn and it motivates me. Where I want to be is 
experienced developer in react, the guy people come to too ask for help. To get there I'm going
to spend my weekend learning and reading more about the language, watching videos, reading 
tutorials and so forth. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team to learn something new?

To this point I could help quite a lot because I had basic knowledge of what we were doing but now
I'm lacking, I've set a goal to learn more now so I can help people when they ask for help. 

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

Participating in the meetings, was there designing the database and setting up the API and also
did the task breakdown and effort estimation. I'm planning on being just as much a part of the next 
sprint and the teams use of scrum there.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

Wrote part of the team reflection but also finished some user stories together with the other team members.
