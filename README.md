### env
Get the environment file from discord and copy it as a hidden file with the name ```.env```

### Node js
Install online or however you feel, make sure ```node -v``` returns the version of node.
### Setup
When you got the repo and node works navigate to the folder and run ```npm i``` then navigate to the client folder
and run ```npm i``` there aswell.

After that you need to run ```npm run build```in the client folder. That is all the setup you need, now
the only thing left is how to run it.
