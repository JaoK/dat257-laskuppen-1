### Contribution Breakdown
  1. Lucas 

     i. Did most of my work in the backend, setting up the dev environment, connecting the database with the backend, the structure of the database.

     ii. Did all the backend work for the book-detail page but left the css, did the entire admin page backend and frontend.
     
     iii. Also worked with scrum and all of its appilcations, communicating with the group, being there during the daily standups, discussing how we prioritize user stories. 
  2. Anton

     i. My contribution has mostly been related to frontend and css which has involved pair programming with different team members. More specifically, I have been involved in the design of the FAQ-page and css design of the webpage. 

     ii. I have had the role of secretary with the goal of keeping the meetings structured and keeping discussions to certain topics. I have tried to make sure we relfect and discuss future improvements on each meeting and improve our workflow. Furtheremore, I have been active during the meetings and tried to contribute with my thoughts and opinions.
     
     
  3. Viktor

     i. Parts of the css on the site, mostly the top list and FAQ-page. Also helped with comments in the backend. Pair programmed setup of architecture and a mix of things here and there as well.

     ii. Read about scrum and applications of scrum in practice. Have been discussing ideas during meetings and been part of bringing our workflow to where it was in the end.

  4. Joakim

     i. I was involved with setting up the development environment, database and external deployment. I also had some prevoius knowledge about React so throughout the whole project I've been helping all the team members with various problems, bugs and other stuff related to the framework and the environment. In the beginning I've played a big role in getting everyone on track with everything. I've contributed to every page and also much to the backend and API.

     ii. I was appointed Project Owner in the beginning so I've had the most contact with the stakeholder. In the meetings with the stakeholder I've been the one makeing sure there is relevant discussions and making sure the meetings progresses. Regarding prioritizing user stories and other stuff related to the scrum-board everyone has been equally involved, so I haven't been "administrating" the scrum-board more than anyone else(as a PO sometimes does/should). 
     
  5. Karl

     i. I have contributed by working on the majority of the pages, mainly focusing on the frontend and thus have written CSS, HTML and Javascript to create responsive pages. I have been doing a lot of pair programming with David, and thus spent a lot of time working on the finalized, glassmorphism design of the website. 

     ii. I have been learning about scrum and the agile workflow, been participating in our meetings where I contributed with my ideas, thoughts and reflections. I also took part of discussing and improving our workflow throughout the project. 
  6. David

     i. I have worked on almost every page of the site and i have written CSS, JS and worked on the frontend and the backend and also worked on making the site functional and responsive to smaller screens. I also worked a lot with developing the current theme of the website.  

     ii. I have been active and have discussed ideas during meetings and tried to bring valuable information and ideas when planning and discussing during meetings.

### Setup
When you got the repo and node works navigate to the folder and run ```npm i``` then navigate to the client folder
and run ```npm i``` there aswell.

After that you need to run ```npm run build```in the client folder. That is all the setup you need, now
the only thing left is how to run it.

### Running
In the main directory run ```node ./index.js``` the site should be up and running on ```localhost:5000```
